Custom Domains - Vault Vision 
========

```{note} CNAME for your custom domain
You may use a custom domain for your Vault Vision tenant, this requires a cname
pointing to nextgenauth.vaultvision.com.
```

## Step 1

Go to the [Start](https://manage.vaultvision.com/start) page in the Vault Vision Management Panel and enter your custom domain. 

## Step 2

Add a cname using your dns provider to point to nextgenauth.vaultvision.com.

## Step 3

Wait for the cname to become active, once DNS resolves we will automatically issue a TLS certificate for your custom domain.
